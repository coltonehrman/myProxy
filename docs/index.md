# MyProxy &middot; [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/garageScript/myProxy.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/garageScript/myproxy)
MyProxy is an application that:
* Helps you connect to your Domain provider
* Setup A and CNAME records for your selected domain
* Create and serve SSL certificates for your selected domains
* Run an unlimited number of applications on your subdomains.

## Why?
Setting up a server is hard, especially setting up DNS records, managing certificates, and deployment. So we setup to build a simple and usable app that helps us build applications quickly.

We are new to software engineering so if you find areas where this app could be improved, please let us know by [creating an issue](https://github.com/garageScript/myproxy/issues). We are excited to learn!

Also, we are currently looking for a job. If your team needs software engineers, please hire us:

## Prerequisites
To use `MyProxy`, you need 2 things:
1. A domain name. MyProxy uses [acme.sh](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi), so you would have to buy the domains from any of the [DNS APIs listed there](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi) (includes all of the major providers like namecheap, goDaddy, etc.)
2. A server's IP address that you have root access to. You can use your home server or get one from [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?hp=tile&so-exp=below), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), [GoogleCloud](https://cloud.google.com/), etc.

# Installation and Usage 
## Installation
1. Connect to your server: `ssh root@your-server-ip-address`

2. Clone the app: `git clone https://github.com/garageScript/myProxy.git`

3. Goto myProxy folder: `cd myProxy`

4. Run Setup Script `./scripts/setup.sh`
    This will installed require dependencies.
    * Installs `nodeJS` and `npm` if system does not have it.
    * Enable firewall port `3000` (for the admin page UI), `80` and `443`.
    * Installs application dependencies
    * For a list of things the script runs, [look here](https://github.com/garageScript/myProxy/blob/master/scripts/setup.sh)

5. Run the App: `ADMIN=YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD npm run server` 
> You can also run the app under your own defined port by setting a `PORT` environment variable

6. Exit from server `exit`

## Usage
1. Go to your server url: `http://your-server-ip-address:3000`. You will be prompted to enter your admin password and your domain provider's API Key and Secret, [find out how here](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi)

2. All your domain names in that provider will show up. Click the `setup` button next to the domain you wish to setup (could take up to 4 minutes)

3. After your domain is setup, you will be able to generate as many subdomain repository as you want! To do that:
    1. Go to your server url:  `http://your-server-ip-address:3000`
    2. Create a subdomain. IP and port are optional. You should see a git link that was created for you.
    3. `git clone` the app, then build the app locally. Find out how in the Building Your Local App section below. 
    4. When you are done, `git push origin master` and watch your app run in production!

## Building-Your-Local-App 
1. In the terminal, run `git clone <your fullDomain repo>` to clone your app folder.
2. Enter your repo `cd <your fullDomain folder>`
3. Run `npm init -y`
4. Run `npm i express --save`
5. Run `touch app.js`
6. Copy the following code into app.js.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.static('public'));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('hello');
});

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 8123);
```

7. Update scripts section of Package.JSON with `"start:myproxy": "node app.js"`
8. Run `git add .`
9. Run `git commit -m "Initial Commit"`
10. Run `git push origin master`
